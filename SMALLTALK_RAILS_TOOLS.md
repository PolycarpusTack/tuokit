3. Optionally add code context
4. Click "Debug Error"

### üìö SmallTalk Snippet Finder (`pages/smalltalk_snippets.py`)

**Purpose:** Generate and manage reusable SmallTalk code snippets

**Features:**
- 10 predefined snippet categories
- Custom task specification
- Snippet library with search
- Quick reference patterns
- Save and retrieve snippets

**Categories:**
- Collections & Iteration
- GUI Development
- File I/O
- Database Access
- Testing & Debugging
- String Manipulation
- Date & Time
- Network & HTTP
- Exception Handling
- Design Patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Shared Utilities

All tools extend the `OllamaToolBase` class from `utils/ollama.py` which provides:
- Automatic query logging to PostgreSQL
- Error handling and retry logic
- Model management
- Response caching

### Models Used

- **SmallTalk Explainer:** `deepseek-r1:6.7b` (reasoning model)
- **Rails Scaffold:** `deepseek-coder:6.7b` (code generation)
- **Code Converter:** `deepseek-coder:6.7b` (code translation)
- **Rails Debugger:** `deepseek-r1:6.7b` (analysis) + `deepseek-coder:6.7b` (fixes)
- **Snippet Finder:** `deepseek-coder:6.7b` (code generation)

### Database Integration

All tools automatically log queries and responses to the PostgreSQL database:
- Tool name
- Model used
- User prompt
- AI response
- Metadata (timestamps, tokens, duration)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Ensure Ollama is running:**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **Pull required models:**
   ```bash
   ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b
   ollama pull deepseek-r1:6.7b
   ```

3. **Database is configured** (already set up in TuoKit)

4. **Access the tools:**
   - From TuoKit dashboard ‚Üí SmallTalk & Rails section
   - Or directly via sidebar navigation

## Best Practices

1. **SmallTalk Development:**
   - Use the Explainer for understanding legacy code
   - Generate snippets for common patterns
   - Convert Ruby examples to SmallTalk idioms

2. **Rails Development:**
   - Generate scaffolds for rapid prototyping
   - Debug errors with context for better solutions
   - Save successful debug sessions for future reference

3. **Cross-Language Work:**
   - Use the converter for porting logic between languages
   - Understand paradigm differences through explanations
   - Build a library of equivalent patterns

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] SmallTalk refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Rails performance analyzer
- [ ] SmallTalk to modern framework converter
- [ ] Rails upgrade assistant
- [ ] Integration with version control
- [ ] Collaborative snippet sharing

## Troubleshooting

**Models not found:**
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b
ollama pull deepseek-r1:6.7b
```

**Database connection issues:**
- Check `.env` file configuration
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check database credentials

**Generation failures:**
- Verify Ollama service is running
- Check model availability
- Review error logs in console
