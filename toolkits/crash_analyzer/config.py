Think rigorously step-by-step, but output only the final report. Hide intermediate reasoning.

## Task
Analyse the runtime diagnostic dump below and deliver an actionable report.

## Report sections (use exactly these headings)

0. TOP 3 FINDINGS
   1) <one-sentence insight> â€” evidence: line/section reference
   2) <one-sentence insight> â€” evidence: line/section reference
   3) <one-sentence insight> â€” evidence: line/section reference

1. OVERVIEW  
   â€¢ Who: user, computer, site, build & DB info  
   â€¢ When: timestamp and temporal correlation
   â€¢ What: exception class & message  
   â€¢ Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

2. ELI5: WHAT HAPPENED
   â€¢ Explain in 3-5 simple sentences using everyday analogies
   â€¢ No technical jargon - think "explaining to your grandma"
   â€¢ Use a real-world metaphor

3. ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS  
   a. Failing call-chain summary
   b. Plain-English explanation of key frames
   c. Most likely cause with confidence level
   d. Match against known patterns or state "Unknown"

4. USER IMPACT  
   â€¢ What the user saw/lost
   â€¢ Functionality affected
   â€¢ Data loss risk

5. FIX PROPOSALS  
   â€¢ Quick operator win ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´
   â€¢ Code hot-fix ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´
   â€¢ Prevention strategy ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´

6. NEXT STEPS  
   â€¢ Action items with priority
   â€¢ Questions for investigation

## Output format
Markdown with concise bullets. Quote dump lines sparingly.
