# üèóÔ∏è TuoKit Camunda Manager - Integration Guide

## Overview

The TuoKit Camunda Manager is an AI-powered assistant for managing external Camunda BPM instances. It helps automate monitoring, incident resolution, and workflow generation for your WHATS'ON integrations.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

### 1. **Process Monitoring**
- Real-time view of active processes
- SLA compliance tracking
- Performance metrics visualization

### 2. **AI-Powered Incident Analysis**
- Automatic root cause analysis
- Suggested fixes with code snippets
- Pattern recognition for common issues

### 3. **Natural Language to BPMN**
- Describe workflows in plain English
- Generate valid BPMN 2.0 XML
- Automatic optimization suggestions

### 4. **WHATS'ON Integration Templates**
- Pre-built patterns for common integrations
- Automated connector configuration
- Error handling and retry logic

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Ensure TuoKit is installed and running
2. The Camunda module is included in the main TuoKit installation
3. Configure your Camunda connection in the UI

### Basic Usage

```python
from toolkits.camunda.manager import CamundaManager

# Initialize manager
manager = CamundaManager("http://your-camunda:8080/engine-rest")

# Monitor processes
active_processes = manager.get_process_instances()

# Analyze incidents
incidents = manager.get_incidents()
for incident in incidents:
    analysis = manager.analyze_incident_with_ai(incident)
    print(analysis['analysis'])

# Generate workflow from description
description = "Receive order, validate payment, ship product, send confirmation"
bpmn_xml = manager.generate_bpmn_from_description(description)
```

## üìã Common Use Cases

### 1. **Automated Incident Resolution**

The system can automatically detect and suggest fixes for common Camunda issues:

- **Missing Variables**: Suggests variable initialization
- **Connection Errors**: Provides retry strategies
- **Timeout Issues**: Recommends SLA adjustments
- **Complex Issues**: Uses AI for deep analysis

### 2. **WHATS'ON Data Synchronization**

Generate workflows for syncing data between WHATS'ON and third-party systems:

```python
config = {
    'entity_type': 'products',
    'target_system': 'SAP',
    'sync_interval': '5 minutes'
}

workflow = generate_whatson_workflow('data_sync', config)
```

### 3. **Approval Chain Automation**

Create complex approval workflows with automatic routing:

```python
config = {
    'approval_type': 'purchase_order',
    'routing_rules': 'amount-based',
    'completion_action': 'create_po_in_erp'
}

workflow = generate_whatson_workflow('approval_chain', config)
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Custom Workflow Enhancement

The system can enhance generated workflows with:
- Error boundary events
- Compensation handlers
- Timer events for SLAs
- Parallel gateways for performance

### Performance Optimization

AI-driven suggestions for:
- Identifying parallelization opportunities
- Removing redundant steps
- Optimizing service task configurations
- Implementing caching strategies

### Integration Patterns

Pre-built patterns for:
- Event-driven architectures
- Batch processing
- Saga pattern implementation
- Circuit breaker patterns

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard

The integrated dashboard provides:
- Real-time process metrics
- SLA compliance visualization
- Incident trending
- Performance bottleneck identification

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Save generated workflows to knowledge base
2. **Testing**: Validate BPMN before deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for SLA breaches
4. **Documentation**: Use AI to generate process documentation

## üîå API Integration

### REST Endpoints

The Camunda Manager can be exposed as REST endpoints:

```python
# In your FastAPI/Flask app
@app.post("/analyze-incident")
async def analyze_incident(incident_id: str):
    manager = CamundaManager()
    incident = manager.get_incident_by_id(incident_id)
    return manager.analyze_incident_with_ai(incident)
```

### Webhook Support

Configure webhooks for:
- Process completion notifications
- Incident alerts
- SLA breach warnings

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**
   - Verify Camunda URL is accessible
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure REST API is enabled

2. **BPMN Generation Errors**
   - Be specific in process descriptions
   - Include decision points explicitly
   - Mention parallel activities

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider async processing for bulk operations

## üìö Knowledge Base Integration

All generated workflows and analyses are automatically saved to TuoKit's knowledge base for:
- Future reference
- Pattern learning
- Team knowledge sharing

## üéØ Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- BPMN visual editor integration
- Automated deployment pipelines
- A/B testing for process variants
- Machine learning for incident prediction
