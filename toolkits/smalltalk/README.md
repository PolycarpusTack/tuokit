# SmallTalk Development Toolkit

## Overview
The SmallTalk Toolkit is a comprehensive suite of tools for SmallTalk development, now refactored from a monolithic 1,378-line file into a modular toolkit structure. The refactoring also fixed a syntax error that was preventing the tool from running.

## Features
The toolkit includes 7 powerful tools:

1. **Class Generator** 🏗️
   - Generate SmallTalk classes with tests and documentation
   - Support for design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Factory, etc.)
   - Framework integration (Seaside, Glorp ORM, Morphic UI)

2. **Code Explainer** 📖
   - Explain SmallTalk code with varying detail levels
   - Focus on specific areas (class structure, methods, patterns)
   - Educational insights for learning

3. **Snippet Generator** ✨
   - Generate code snippets for common tasks
   - 10 categories covering collections, GUI, file I/O, testing, etc.
   - Multiple complexity levels

4. **Code Refactorer** 🔧
   - Apply refactoring techniques (Extract Method, Rename Variable, etc.)
   - Preserve behavior while improving code quality
   - SmallTalk best practices

5. **Ruby Converter** 💎
   - Convert between SmallTalk and Ruby bidirectionally
   - Handle blocks, collections, and OOP structures
   - Preserve idiomatic patterns

6. **Seaside Generator** 🌊
   - Generate Seaside web components
   - Support for different component types
   - AJAX functionality and decorations

7. **Metaprogramming** 🧙
   - Advanced metaprogramming solutions
   - Runtime class/method creation
   - Reflection and method wrappers

## Module Structure
```
toolkits/smalltalk/
├── __init__.py          # Public API exports (8 lines)
├── analyzer.py          # Main TuoKitToolBase class (206 lines)
├── config.py            # Configuration constants (133 lines)
├── generators.py        # Code generation functions (126 lines)
├── processors.py        # Code analysis and transformation (156 lines)
└── ui_components.py     # UI widgets and tool interfaces (426 lines)
```

**Total**: 1,055 lines split into focused modules (vs 1,378 lines monolithic)
**Page wrapper**: 12 lines (thin wrapper)

## Key Improvements
1. **Fixed Syntax Error**: F-string expression with backslash issue resolved
2. **Better Organization**: Each tool has its own UI function
3. **Reusable Components**: Generators and processors can be used independently
4. **Automatic Knowledge Capture**: Inherits from TuoKitToolBase
5. **Consistent UI**: All tools follow same patterns

## Usage
```python
from toolkits.smalltalk import SmallTalkToolkit

toolkit = SmallTalkToolkit()
toolkit.run()
```

## Configuration
All configuration is centralized in `config.py`:
- Tool categories and descriptions
- Snippet categories with subcategories
- Refactoring techniques
- Model defaults

## Future Enhancements (TODOs)
- Add live SmallTalk environment integration
- Support for more SmallTalk dialects (Pharo, Squeak, etc.)
- Visual class diagram generation
- Integration with SmallTalk package managers
- Export to SmallTalk image format
