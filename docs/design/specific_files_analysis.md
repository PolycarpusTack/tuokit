# TuoKit: Specific Files Analysis from Coding Assistants

## üîç What Can Actually Be Used/Transformed

### ‚úÖ OpenHands - MOST VALUABLE (Python-based!)

#### Directly Adaptable Files:
```
openhands/agents/base.py          ‚Üí TuoKit agent base class
openhands/memory/                 ‚Üí Memory management patterns
openhands/controller/state.py     ‚Üí State management
openhands/storage/               ‚Üí Storage patterns
openhands/core/                  ‚Üí Core abstractions
```

#### Why These Work:
- Written in Python
- Clean abstractions
- No heavy dependencies for core logic
- Well-documented patterns

#### Transformation Needed:
- Remove Docker dependencies
- Simplify event system
- Replace complex RPC with simple function calls
- Adapt to Streamlit instead of web UI

### üìö Documentation Files - VALUABLE

```
CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_COMPARISON.md  ‚Üí Context strategy insights
goose/ARCHITECTURE.md            ‚Üí Plugin architecture ideas
*/README.md files                ‚Üí Understanding design decisions
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Goose - STUDY ONLY (Rust)

#### Valuable Patterns to Study:
```
goose-mcp/src/developer/mod.rs   ‚Üí Tool registration pattern
goose-mcp/src/memory/            ‚Üí Persistence approach
goose/crates/goose/src/         ‚Üí Extension system design
```

#### Cannot Use Directly:
- All Rust code
- Would need complete rewrite
- Study the patterns, not the code

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Tabby - STUDY ONLY (Rust)

#### Valuable Concepts:
```
tabby-index/                     ‚Üí Indexing strategy
tabby-common/                    ‚Üí Common patterns
```

#### Why Not Directly Usable:
- Rust codebase
- Custom CUDA kernels
- Complex build system

### ‚ùå Not Useful for TuoKit

```
claude-code/     ‚Üí No source code, just configs
codex/           ‚Üí TypeScript, GitHub-specific
atlassian-*/     ‚Üí Unknown/corporate specific
containers/      ‚Üí Docker configs we don't need
.github/         ‚Üí CI/CD we don't need
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Extraction Plan

### Phase 1: OpenHands Mining (Highest Value)

1. **Extract Agent Framework**
```python
# From openhands/agents/base.py
# Transform their Agent class to TuoKit style
# Remove Docker, simplify event system
```

2. **Adapt Memory Management**
```python
# From openhands/memory/
# Use their patterns but with PostgreSQL
# Simplify their history management
```

3. **Learn Controller Patterns**
```python
# From openhands/controller/
# Understand their state machine
# Implement simplified version
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Study (Medium Value)

1. **Goose MCP Concepts**
- Understand tool registration
- Learn prompt management
- See how they handle errors

2. **Tabby Indexing Ideas**
- Understand their AST approach
- Learn their search algorithms
- Apply to Python-only first

### Phase 3: Documentation Wisdom (Quick Wins)

1. **Context Management Strategies**
- Implement Claude Code's /compact concept
- Use Goose's visual indicators
- Apply OpenHands' state preservation

## üìÇ Specific Code Transformation Examples

### From OpenHands agent.py:
```python
# ORIGINAL (OpenHands)
class Agent(ABC):
    def __init__(self, llm: LLM):
        self.llm = llm
        self._registry = Registry()
        
# TRANSFORMED (TuoKit)
class TuoKitAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, model: str = "deepseek-r1"):
        self.name = name
        self.model = model
        self.memory = AgentMemory()  # Simplified
```

### From Goose's tool pattern:
```rust
// ORIGINAL (Rust)
#[tool]
fn example(&self) { }

# TRANSFORMED (Python)
@tool("Description here")
def example(self):
    pass
```

## üéØ Action Items

### Immediate (This Week):
1. Clone OpenHands patterns from:
   - `openhands/agents/base.py`
   - `openhands/memory/memory.py`
   - `openhands/controller/state.py`

2. Read and extract insights from:
   - `CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_COMPARISON.md`
   - `goose/ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Next Week:
1. Study Goose MCP patterns (don't code, just understand)
2. Design TuoKit plugin system inspired by Goose
3. Create simplified agent framework from OpenHands

### Later:
1. Implement Tabby-inspired indexing (Python only)
2. Add context management UI
3. Build knowledge base system

## üí° Key Takeaway

**OpenHands is our goldmine** - It's Python-based and has clean patterns we can adapt. Focus 80% effort there, 20% on studying patterns from others.

The rest (Goose, Tabby) are for inspiration only - we learn their ideas but write our own Python implementations from scratch.
