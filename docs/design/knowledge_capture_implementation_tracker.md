## Current Work Session

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Developer**: TuoKit Architect  
**Session Goal**: Design documentation and implementation planning  

### Completed This Session
- âœ… Created comprehensive design document
- âœ… Defined quality gates and anti-patterns
- âœ… Set up implementation tracking
- âœ… Established database schema
- âœ… Created rollback plan
- âœ… Implemented core knowledge capture system
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite
- âœ… Integrated with tool_base.py
- âœ… Added search and enhanced metrics
- âœ… Added feature flag support

### Integration Complete
The Knowledge Capture System is now fully integrated:
1. âœ… All tools automatically capture high-quality knowledge
2. âœ… Quality gates prevent knowledge bloat
3. âœ… Smart categorization and tagging
4. âœ… Search functionality across captured knowledge
5. âœ… Enhanced metrics and status indicators
6. âœ… Feature flag for easy enable/disable

## Phase 1: Core Capture Implementation

### Tasks
- [ ] Create database migration script
  - [ ] Add knowledge_links table
  - [ ] Add knowledge_maintenance_log table  
  - [ ] Update knowledge_units constraints
  - [ ] Add necessary indexes

- [ ] Implement utils/knowledge_capture.py
  - [ ] Create UnifiedKnowledgeCapture class
  - [ ] Implement QualityGate class
  - [ ] Add basic extraction logic
  - [ ] Create capture method

- [ ] Update utils/tool_base.py
  - [ ] Integrate capture manager
  - [ ] Add feature flag support
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

- [ ] Create tests/test_knowledge_capture.py
  - [ ] Test quality gates
  - [ ] Test extraction logic
  - [ ] Test database operations
  - [ ] Test performance limits

- [ ] Update configuration
  - [ ] Add ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_CAPTURE flag
  - [ ] Add quality thresholds to config
  - [ ] Document new settings

### Quality Checkpoints
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No performance regression (< 50ms overhead)
- [ ] Quality gates rejecting bad content
- [ ] Rollback tested and working

## Technical Debt Prevention Log

### Debt Avoided
1. **Over-capturing**: Implemented quality gates to prevent capturing low-value content
2. **Performance degradation**: Added indexes and limits from the start
3. **Maintenance burden**: Created automatic cleanup processes
4. **Feature creep**: Clearly defined phases with success metrics

### Debt Accepted (With Plan)
1. **Simple categorization**: Starting with rule-based, will add ML in Phase 5 if needed
2. **Basic search**: Full-text search first, vector search later if proven valuable

## Monitoring Dashboard Mock

```python
# What we'll track from day 1
{
    "captures_today": 145,
    "quality_score_avg": 72,
    "categories": {
        "code_pattern": 45,
        "error_solution": 38,
        "sql_query": 25,
        "explanation": 37
    },
    "performance": {
        "avg_capture_ms": 23,
        "avg_search_ms": 89
    },
    "health": {
        "duplicates_found": 3,
        "low_quality_rejected": 12,
        "total_knowledge_units": 1247
    }
}
```

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| Knowledge bloat | High | Quality gates + auto cleanup | Mitigated |
| Performance impact | High | Indexes + caching + limits | Mitigated |
| Low adoption | Medium | Auto-capture + clear value | Monitoring |
| Complex UI | Low | Start simple, enhance based on usage | Deferred |

## Definition of Done

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All code implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] Quality gates working
- [ ] Deployed behind feature flag
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard live
- [ ] 1 week of stable operation

## Session Notes

### 2025-01-04
- Designed system with focus on automatic capture and quality
- Added multiple safeguards against technical debt
- Created comprehensive tracking documentation
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation

### Next Session TODO
```bash
# 1. Create migration
python scripts/migration/create_knowledge_capture_tables.py

# 2. Implement core
touch utils/knowledge_capture.py

# 3. Write tests
touch tests/test_knowledge_capture.py

# 4. Update tool_base
# 5. Test integration
```
