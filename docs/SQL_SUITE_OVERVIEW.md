- Unified safety checks
- Common knowledge base

## When to Use Each Tool

### Use SQL Pipeline When:
- You're new to SQL
- You want a guided process
- You need to test queries quickly
- You want to learn SQL concepts
- You need plain English explanations

### Use SQL Generator When:
- You need complex queries
- You want database connectivity
- You need schema-aware generation
- You want multiple SQL dialects
- You need stored procedures

### Use SQL Optimizer When:
- You have slow queries
- You need index recommendations
- You want professional validation
- You need to detect anti-patterns
- You want confidence scores

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Pipeline
Even experienced users benefit from the Pipeline's structured approach for new queries.

### 2. Progress to Generator
As queries become complex, move to the Generator for more control.

### 3. Always Optimize Critical Queries
Use the Optimizer for any query that will run frequently or on large datasets.

### 4. Build Your Knowledge Base
Save successful patterns from all tools for team reuse.

### 5. Test Before Production
Use Pipeline's test feature or Generator's preview before production deployment.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Monthly Report Query
1. **Pipeline**: Describe "monthly sales by region"
2. **Generate**: Get initial SQL
3. **Optimize**: Improve performance
4. **Test**: Verify with sample data
5. **Save**: Store in knowledge base

### Scenario: Database Migration
1. **Generator**: Connect to source database
2. **Generate**: Create queries with schema
3. **Optimizer**: Ensure optimal performance
4. **Save**: Document migration queries

### Scenario: Performance Issue
1. **Optimizer**: Paste slow query
2. **Analyze**: Review recommendations
3. **Test**: Verify improvements
4. **Implement**: Apply to production

## Tips for Success

### For Best Results:
- Be specific in descriptions
- Use appropriate tool for task
- Test with realistic data
- Save successful patterns
- Learn from explanations

### Avoid These Mistakes:
- Starting with complex queries
- Skipping optimization step
- Not testing edge cases
- Ignoring validation warnings
- Not saving useful queries

## Future Enhancements

The SQL Suite continues to evolve:
- Live database connections in Pipeline
- Query performance benchmarking
