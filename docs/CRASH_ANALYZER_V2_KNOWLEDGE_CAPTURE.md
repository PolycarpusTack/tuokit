# Crash Analyzer V2 - Knowledge Capture Enhancement

## Overview
The Crash Analyzer V2 has been enhanced with full knowledge capture and save functionality, allowing users to build a comprehensive knowledge base of crash analyses over time.

## New Features

### 1. Save Analysis Button ðŸ’¾
After running any crash analysis, users can now save the results to the knowledge base with a single click.

**How it works:**
- Click the "ðŸ’¾ Save Analysis" button in the results display
- The analysis is automatically saved to the database
- A unique query ID is generated for tracking
- Results are also saved to the knowledge base for long-term reference

**What gets saved:**
- Analysis method used
- Filename analyzed
- Timestamp of analysis
- Complete analysis results
- Severity and error type metadata
- Confidence scores

### 2. Knowledge Base Button ðŸ§ 
The previously placeholder "Knowledge Base" button is now fully functional, providing access to all saved crash analyses.

**Features:**
- View all saved crash analyses
- See analysis method, filename, and timestamp
- Expand to view full results
- Quick access to reanalyze saved results
- Search and filter capabilities (coming soon)

### 3. Automatic Knowledge Capture
Every saved analysis is automatically captured in the knowledge base with intelligent categorization:
- **Critical Issue** - For CRITICAL or HIGH severity crashes
- **Error Solution** - For other crash analyses

## Technical Implementation

### Database Integration
- Uses TuoKit's centralized `DatabaseManager`
- Stores analyses in both `query_history` and `knowledge_base` tables
- Maintains relationships between queries and knowledge units

### TuoKitToolBase Integration
- Inherits knowledge capture capabilities from `TuoKitToolBase`
- Uses `save_to_knowledge_base()` method for structured storage
- Automatic quality scoring and categorization

### UI Enhancements
- Save functionality integrated into `results_display.py`
- Knowledge Base viewer in main analyzer interface
- Real-time success/error feedback

## Usage Guide

### Saving an Analysis
1. Upload a crash dump file
2. Select an analysis method
3. Run the analysis
4. Once complete, click "ðŸ’¾ Save Analysis"
5. See confirmation message with query ID

### Viewing Knowledge Base
1. Click "ðŸ§  Knowledge Base" in Additional Tools
2. Browse saved analyses
3. Click on any analysis to expand details
4. Use "ðŸ”„ View Full Analysis" to reload results

### Building Knowledge Over Time
- Save important crash analyses for reference
- Build patterns of common issues
- Create a searchable repository of solutions
- Track crash trends across projects

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Quick access to previous crash solutions
- Pattern recognition across similar crashes
- Build institutional knowledge
- Reduce debugging time

### For Teams
- Share crash analysis knowledge
- Consistent analysis approach
- Historical tracking of issues
- Knowledge transfer between team members

### For Projects
- Track recurring issues
- Identify systemic problems
- Document crash resolutions
- Build crash analysis playbooks

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Search Functionality** - Search by error type, severity, or content
2. **Pattern Detection** - Automatically identify similar crashes
3. **Trend Analysis** - Visualize crash patterns over time
4. **Export/Import** - Share knowledge bases between teams
5. **AI Insights** - Generate insights from accumulated knowledge

### Integration Opportunities
- Connect with issue tracking systems
- Automated alerts for critical patterns
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Knowledge base API for external tools

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_crash_analyzer_v2_save.py -v
```

All tests should pass, confirming:
- Database connection initialization
- Save functionality
- Knowledge base integration
- Data structure integrity

## Conclusion

The Crash Analyzer V2 now provides a complete knowledge management solution for crash analysis, turning every debugging session into a learning opportunity that benefits the entire team.
