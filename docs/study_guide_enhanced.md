# Study Guide Generator - Enhanced Features

## Overview
The Study Guide Generator now includes advanced learning features for long-term retention and content accuracy validation, following cognitive science principles while maintaining TuoKit's practical approach.

## New Features (v2.0)

### 1. Content Accuracy Validation
- **Quick Accuracy Check**: Automated validation against source material
- **Issue Detection**: Identifies potential hallucinations and unverified claims
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0-10 scale indicating content reliability
- **Pattern Recognition**: Checks for common accuracy issues (dates, numbers, references)

### 2. Spaced Repetition System
- **Automated Scheduling**: Generates optimal review dates based on forgetting curve
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Intervals adapt to content difficulty level
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors retention over multiple study sessions
- **Export Functionality**: Download review schedule for calendar integration

### 3. Learning Analytics
- **Retention Estimation**: Tracks knowledge retention across sessions
- **Session History**: Stores study session data in Knowledge Library
- **Performance Metrics**: Quiz scores linked to content for improvement tracking

## Enhanced Workflow

### 1. Pre-Generation Setup
```
1. Select input method (Text/File/URL)
2. Configure difficulty and objective
3. Enable options:
   ✓ Save to Knowledge Library
   ✓ Enable Spaced Repetition
   ✓ Validate Accuracy
4. Click "Generate Study Guide"
```

### 2. Accuracy Validation Process
- Automatic validation runs after content generation
- Displays accuracy score and confidence level
- Lists specific issues found (if any)
- Color-coded indicators:
  - Green (8-10): High accuracy
  - Yellow (6-7): Medium accuracy  
  - Red (0-5): Low accuracy

### 3. Spaced Repetition Schedule
- Access via "Review Schedule" tab
- Shows optimal review dates for each concept
- Based on scientifically-proven intervals:
  - Day 1: Initial learning
  - Day 3: First review
  - Day 7: Second review
  - Day 14: Third review
  - Day 30: Fourth review
  - Day 60: Final reinforcement

## Technical Implementation

### SimpleLearningStrategy
- Practical spaced repetition without complex algorithms
- Stores data in existing database structure (no new tables)
- Adjustable intervals based on difficulty
- Retention tracking via metadata

### SimpleContentValidator
- Pattern-based accuracy checking
- No external dependencies or API calls
- Fast validation focusing on common issues
- Optional AI validation for deeper checks

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Retention
1. **Complete Initial Study**: Go through all materials thoroughly
2. **Take the Quiz**: Establishes baseline knowledge
3. **Follow Schedule**: Review on suggested dates
4. **Track Progress**: Check retention estimates over time

### For Content Accuracy
1. **Review Flagged Issues**: Check any highlighted inaccuracies
2. **Cross-Reference Sources**: Verify important claims
3. **Regenerate if Needed**: Low accuracy scores warrant regeneration
4. **Use Larger Models**: Better accuracy with 6.7b vs 1.5b models

## Data Privacy & Storage
- All learning data stored locally in PostgreSQL
- No external tracking or analytics services
- Session data linked via content hash (anonymized)
- User can delete their learning history anytime

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] Multi-user profiles with individual learning paths
- [ ] Advanced retention algorithms (SM-2, Leitner)
- [ ] Integration with calendar applications
- [ ] Mobile-friendly review interface
- [ ] Collaborative study groups
- [ ] Performance comparison metrics
- [ ] AI tutor for personalized explanations

## Troubleshooting

### Accuracy Validation Issues
- **"No validation result"**: Ensure content was generated successfully
- **Many false positives**: Adjust validation patterns in settings
- **Slow validation**: Use smaller content chunks or disable

### Spaced Repetition Problems
- **No schedule generated**: Enable option before generating
- **Missing concepts**: Ensure key terms were extracted
- **Schedule not updating**: Clear session and regenerate

## Example Use Case

### Medical Student Workflow
1. Upload anatomy textbook chapter (PDF)
2. Set to "Advanced" difficulty, "Exam Preparation"
3. Enable all features (library, repetition, validation)
4. Generate comprehensive study materials
5. Review accuracy score (aim for 8+)
6. Complete initial study session
7. Export spaced repetition schedule
8. Review on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 30
9. Track retention improvement over time

This enhanced Study Guide Generator transforms passive reading into active, scientifically-optimized learning while maintaining TuoKit's commitment to practical, working solutions.
