   - Concrete implementations, not abstractions
   - Working code over theoretical perfection

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Input validation in all agents
   - Graceful fallbacks
   - Clear error messages

4. **Extensibility**
   - Modular design for easy additions
   - Standard agent interface
   - Plugin-ready architecture

5. **Knowledge Building**
   - All agents save to knowledge base
   - Structured output formats
   - Automatic categorization

## Usage Examples

### System Architecture Design
```python
agent = SystemArchitectAgent()
architecture = agent.generate_architecture(
    "E-commerce platform supporting 100k users"
)
# Returns complete architecture with components, risks, costs
```

### Deep Research
```python
agent = DeepResearchAgent()
report = agent.research_topic(
    "Kubernetes auto-scaling for ML workloads"
)
# Returns comprehensive report with implementations
```

### Data Analysis
```python
agent = DataAnalysisAgent()
result = agent.natural_language_query(
    "Show me top products by sales",
    table_schema
)
# Returns SQL query and results
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all integrations:
```bash
python test_agent_enhancements.py
```

## Running the Enhanced Hub

```bash
streamlit run pages/agent_hub_enhanced.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Add rate limiting for expensive operations
   - Implement caching for research results
   - Add user authentication for advanced features

2. **Vision Integration**
   - Connect actual vision model when available
   - Enable code screenshot analysis
   - Support architecture diagram understanding

3. **Vector Search**
