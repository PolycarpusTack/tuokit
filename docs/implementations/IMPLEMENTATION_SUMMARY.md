   - JSON metrics for automation

## ðŸŽ¨ Code Architecture Improvements

1. **Modular Design**
   - Separate classes for each major feature
   - `TechnologyDetector` - Language detection
   - `DependencyAnalyzer` - Package analysis
   - `ExternalToolRunner` - Tool integration
   - `ScanProfile` - Configuration management
   - `SARIFExporter` - Export functionality

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when tools are missing
   - Timeout handling for external tools
   - File encoding error recovery
   - Detailed error reporting

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - File caching to avoid re-reading
   - Configurable file limits per profile
   - Efficient regex compilation
   - Parallel capability (ready for Phase 3)

## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics and Scoring

The new scoring system provides more nuanced analysis:

- **Security Score**: 40% weight
  - Critical issues: -20 points each
  - High issues: -10 points each
  - Other issues: -2 points each

- **Quality Score**: 35% weight
  - Syntax errors: -15 points each
  - Technical debt: -0.5 points each

- **Performance Score**: 25% weight
  - High severity: -15 points each
  - Other issues: -3 points each

## ðŸ”„ Migration Path

For users of the original scanner:

1. **Data Compatibility**
   - New scanner can analyze the same file types
   - Backup directory structure maintained
   - Similar issue detection for existing patterns

2. **Feature Parity**
