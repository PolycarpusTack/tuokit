def calculate_discount(price, discount):
    return price - discount
    
# Error: Doesn't handle percentage discounts
```

**Actions:**
1. Click "Explain Code" ‚Üí Understand the issue
2. Click "Debug Code" ‚Üí Get corrected version
3. Save solution to Knowledge Base

### Document Tools Demo (3 min)
1. Upload sample PDF (research paper or technical doc)
2. Generate summary ‚Üí Show key points extraction
3. Ask specific question: "What methodology was used?"
4. Extract structured knowledge ‚Üí Show JSON output

### Knowledge Library Demo (3 min)
1. Search for saved discount calculation
2. Show category filtering
3. Edit to add notes
4. Export entire knowledge base

## üîç Demo Preparation Checklist

### Reset for Clean Demo
```bash
# Clear previous data (optional)
psql -U ollama_user -d ollama_knowledge -c "TRUNCATE queries, knowledge_units CASCADE;"

# Add sample knowledge
psql -U ollama_user -d ollama_knowledge -f sample_knowledge_data.sql
```

### Files to Prepare
1. **buggy_code.py** - Function with subtle bug
   ```python
   def calculate_discount(price, discount):
       # Bug: assumes discount is dollar amount, not percentage
       return price - discount
   ```

2. **sample_document.pdf** - Technical paper or meeting notes

3. **error_example.txt** - Python traceback
   ```
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "app.py", line 42, in process
       result = calculate_discount(100, 20)
   ValueError: Discount calculation incorrect
   ```
