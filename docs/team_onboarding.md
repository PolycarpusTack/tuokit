- Knowledge units = your saved insights

**Activity Feed**
- Shows recent AI interactions
- Click any item to see full details

**Navigation**
- Sidebar has all tools
- Help button on every page

### 3. Your First AI Interaction
Try this in Code Tools:
```python
# Paste this code
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"

# Click "Analyze Code"
# The AI will explain what this function does
```

### 4. Save Your First Knowledge
After the AI explains:
1. Click "Save to Knowledge Base"
2. Give it a title: "Python Greeting Function"
3. Select category: "Code Snippet"
4. Click "Save to Library"

**Congratulations!** You've created your first knowledge unit.

## üìö Day 2: Core Tools Mastery (45 minutes)

### Code Tools Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Debug Code
```python
# This has a bug - paste it
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    return a / b

# Error: ZeroDivisionError when b = 0
```
- Use "Debug Code" to get the fix
- Save the solution

#### Exercise 2: Generate Code
Ask for: "Create a function to check if a number is prime"
- Review generated code
- Test it in your IDE
- Save if useful

### Document Tools Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Document Summary
1. Upload `test_document.txt` (in project folder)
2. Click "Summarize"
3. Review key points extracted

#### Exercise 2: Document Q&A
With the same document:
1. Ask: "What are the action items?"
2. Ask: "What is the project timeline?"
3. Save useful answers

### Knowledge Library Practice

1. **Search**: Find "prime" (from earlier exercise)
2. **Filter**: Show only "Code Snippets"
3. **Edit**: Add a comment to any entry
4. **Export**: Download your knowledge

## üöÄ Day 3: Advanced Workflows (30 minutes)

### Workflow 1: Code Review Preparation
1. Paste complex code in Code Tools
2. Get explanation
3. Ask specific questions in a new analysis
4. Compile insights in Knowledge Library

### Workflow 2: Documentation Analysis
1. Upload technical PDF
2. Generate summary first
3. Extract structured knowledge (JSON)
4. Ask targeted questions
5. Build a knowledge document

### Workflow 3: Problem Solving
1. Start with error message in Debug tool
2. Get initial fix
3. Search Knowledge Library for similar issues
4. Combine solutions
5. Document final solution

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Effective Prompting
**Good Prompts:**
- "Explain the security implications of this code"
- "Generate a Python class for managing user sessions with proper error handling"
- "What design patterns are used in this document?"

**Poor Prompts:**
- "Fix this" (too vague)
- "Make it better" (no context)
- "Help" (no specific ask)

### 2. Knowledge Management
**Naming Convention:**
```
[Date] - [Tool] - [Brief Description]
Example: "2025-01-07 - Code Debug - Fix Async API Timeout"
```

**Categories:**
- Use specific categories consistently
- Create project-specific categories
- Review and clean up weekly

### 3. Model Selection
- **deepseek-coder:6.7b** ‚Üí Best for code
- **deepseek-r1:6.7b** ‚Üí Best for analysis
- **deepseek-r1:1.5b** ‚Üí Faster responses
