# Knowledge Library Usage Guide

## Overview
The Knowledge Library is your centralized repository for all AI-generated insights, code snippets, and document summaries. It provides powerful search, organization, and reuse capabilities.

## Features

### üîç Search & Filter
- **Full-text search**: Search across titles and content
- **Category filtering**: Focus on specific types of knowledge
- **Sort options**: Newest first, oldest first, or alphabetical by title

### üìã Knowledge Actions
- **Copy**: One-click copy to clipboard
- **Edit**: Update knowledge in-place without navigation
- **Export**: Download individual items as text files
- **Delete**: Safe deletion with confirmation

### üìä Analytics Dashboard
- Total knowledge units
- Category distribution
- Weekly activity tracking
- Visual progress bars for category breakdown

### üì• Bulk Export
Export your entire knowledge base as a formatted Markdown document with:
- All knowledge units
- Complete metadata (dates, tools, models)
- Organized by creation date

## Categories

### Code-Related
- **Code Snippet**: Reusable code fragments
- **Algorithm**: Complete algorithm implementations
- **Error Solution**: Debugging solutions
- **Utility Function**: Helper functions

### Document-Related
- **Document Summary**: Key points from documents
- **Research Findings**: Important discoveries
- **Meeting Notes**: Action items and decisions
- **Technical Documentation**: Reference materials

## Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Naming
Use descriptive titles that include:
- The problem solved
- The technology used
- The date (for time-sensitive content)

Example: "Python API Client with Rate Limiting - 2025"

### 2. Category Selection
Choose the most specific category:
- Use "Code Snippet" for small, reusable pieces
- Use "Algorithm" for complete solutions
- Use "Error Solution" when solving specific errors

### 3. Regular Maintenance
- Review and update outdated knowledge
- Delete duplicates
- Export backups regularly

## Workflow Examples

### Finding Reusable Code
1. Search for "API client"
2. Filter by "Code Snippet" category
3. Click "Copy" on the relevant result
4. Paste into your IDE

### Documenting Solutions
1. After solving a complex problem in Code Tools
2. Save to Knowledge Base with descriptive title
3. Choose appropriate category
4. Add to library for future reference

### Knowledge Review
1. Sort by "Oldest" to find outdated content
2. Edit to update with new information
3. Or delete if no longer relevant

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+K`: Focus search box (when implemented)
- `Escape`: Close expanded knowledge unit

## Tips & Tricks

### Effective Searching
- Use specific technical terms
- Search for error messages
- Try partial words for broader results

### Organization
- Create naming conventions for your team
- Use categories consistently
- Regular cleanup sessions

### Sharing Knowledge
1. Use bulk export for team knowledge sharing
2. Individual exports for specific solutions
3. Copy formatted content for documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working
- Check database connection
- Ensure search terms are spelled correctly
- Try broader search terms

### Export Issues
- Verify database permissions
- Check available disk space
- Try exporting smaller batches

### Edit Mode Problems
- Refresh page if stuck in edit mode
- Check for special characters in content
- Ensure database connection is stable
