# Training LLMs on Your Smalltalk Codebase: Options & Approaches

## üéØ Yes, You Can Train an LLM on Your Smalltalk Code!

### Three Main Approaches:

## 1. üîç RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**What we just implemented**

```
Your Code ‚Üí Search Index ‚Üí Context for LLM ‚Üí Better Answers
```

**Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ Find and reference existing code
- ‚úÖ Answer questions about your system
- ‚úÖ Explain how things work
- ‚ùå Generate genuinely new Smalltalk patterns
- ‚ùå Understand Smalltalk idioms deeply

**Example:**
```
Q: "How does MgX handle scheduling conflicts?"
A: "Based on MgX-Schedule-Manager.st lines 234-267, conflicts are resolved by..."
```

## 2. üéì Fine-Tuning (What You're Asking About)
**Training the LLM on your code**

```
Your Smalltalk Code ‚Üí Training Process ‚Üí Specialized Smalltalk LLM
```

**Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ Generate new Smalltalk code in YOUR style
- ‚úÖ Understand YOUR design patterns
- ‚úÖ Create similar modules/classes
- ‚úÖ Write idiomatic Smalltalk for your system
- ‚úÖ Suggest architectural improvements

**Example:**
```
Q: "Write a new MgX module for handling streaming rights"
A: [Generates complete Smalltalk module following your patterns]

Object subclass: #MgXStreamingRights
    instanceVariableNames: 'territory platform startDate endDate'
    classVariableNames: 'DefaultDuration'
    poolDictionaries: ''
    category: 'MgX-Rights-Streaming'

!MgXStreamingRights methodsFor: 'validation'!
validateTerritory: aTerritory
    "Validate streaming territory using MgX patterns"
    ^self territoryManager validateForStreaming: aTerritory
! !
```

## 3. üöÄ LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
**Efficient fine-tuning approach**

```
Base LLM + Your Smalltalk Patterns ‚Üí Specialized Adapter
```

**Best of both worlds:**
- ‚úÖ Cheaper than full fine-tuning
- ‚úÖ Can swap between different specializations
- ‚úÖ Maintains general knowledge + your specifics
- ‚úÖ Quick to train (hours vs days)

## üìä Comparison for Your Use Case

| Approach | Cost | Time | Quality for Smalltalk | New Code Generation |
|----------|------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| RAG | Free | Minutes | Good for lookup | Limited |
| Fine-Tuning | $$$ | Days | Excellent | Excellent |
| LoRA | $$ | Hours | Very Good | Very Good |

## üéì How to Fine-Tune on Your Smalltalk Code

### Option 1: Local Fine-Tuning (Recommended for Start)
```bash
# Using Ollama + your data
1. Prepare training data from C:/whatson/*.st files
2. Format as instruction pairs:

{
  "instruction": "Create a Smalltalk method for validating broadcast rights",
  "input": "The method should check territory and time window",
  "output": "validateBroadcastRights: aRight\n    \"Validate broadcast rights per MgX rules\"\n    (self checkTerritory: aRight territory) ifFalse: [^false].\n    (self checkTimeWindow: aRight) ifFalse: [^false].\n    ^true"
}

3. Fine-tune using tools like:
   - Ollama (with modelfile)
   - LLaMA-Factory
   - Axolotl
   - Unsloth
```

### Option 2: Cloud Fine-Tuning (Better Results)
```python
# Using OpenAI, Anthropic, or others
import openai

# Prepare your Smalltalk training data
training_data = prepare_smalltalk_examples("C:/whatson/*.st")

# Fine-tune
model = openai.FineTune.create(
    training_file=training_data,
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    suffix="mgx-smalltalk"
)
```

### Option 3: Specialized Code LLMs
Fine-tune models already good at code:
- **CodeLlama**: Best for code generation
- **DeepSeek-Coder**: Excellent for understanding
- **StarCoder**: Good balance

## üìö Training Data Preparation for Smalltalk

### 1. Extract Pattern Examples
```python
def extract_smalltalk_patterns(directory="C:/whatson"):
    patterns = []
    
    # Extract class definitions
    # Extract method implementations  
    # Extract test cases
    # Extract comments/documentation
    
    return [
        {
            "context": "MgX broadcasting system",
            "instruction": "Create a rights validator",
            "code": actual_code_from_your_system
        }
    ]
```

### 2. Create Instruction Pairs
```json
[
  {
    "system": "You are an expert Smalltalk developer for the MgX broadcasting system",
    "user": "Write a method to check schedule conflicts",
    "assistant": "[Actual method from your codebase]"
  },
  {
    "system": "You are an expert in WHATS'On MgX architecture",
    "user": "Create a new Store subclass for handling streaming platforms",
    "assistant": "[Generated based on your Store patterns]"
  }
]
```

### 3. Include Your Design Patterns
- How you structure MgX modules
- Your naming conventions
- Your error handling patterns
- Your testing approaches

## üöÄ Practical Approach for You

### Phase 1: Start with Enhanced RAG (Now)
```python
# We already have this!
# But enhance it with Smalltalk-specific understanding:

def chunk_smalltalk_semantically(code):
    """Parse Smalltalk into meaningful chunks"""
    # Extract classes with their full context
    # Keep method categories together
    # Preserve metaclass relationships
```

### Phase 2: Local LoRA Training (Next Week)
```bash
# Train a small model on your patterns
1. Extract 1000 best Smalltalk examples from C:/whatson
2. Use Ollama or llama.cpp for local training
3. Create "mgx-smalltalk-assistant"
4. Test with: "Write a new MgX module for X"
```

### Phase 3: Full Fine-Tuning (If Needed)
```python
# If LoRA isn't enough, do full fine-tuning
# This will create a model that "thinks" in your Smalltalk style
```

## üí° What You Could Build

### With a Fine-Tuned Smalltalk Model:

1. **Code Generator**
```smalltalk
"Generate new MgX module for podcast rights management"
‚Üí Complete module following your patterns
```

2. **Architecture Assistant**
```
"Suggest how to refactor MgX-Schedule for better performance"
‚Üí Specific suggestions based on your codebase patterns
```

3. **Migration Helper**
```
"Convert this MgX-Rights module to TypeScript"
‚Üí Translation that preserves your business logic
```

4. **Test Generator**
```
"Write tests for MgXContentValidator"
‚Üí Tests in your testing style
```

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Current RAG (Today)
```python
# Add to toolkits/llm_rag_v2/smalltalk_parser.py
class SmalltalkChunker:
    def parse_smalltalk(self, file_path):
        # Extract classes, methods, comments
        # Understand Smalltalk structure
        # Create semantic chunks
```

### 2. Prepare Training Data (This Week)
```python
# Create training_data_prep.py
def prepare_smalltalk_training():
    # Extract patterns from C:/whatson/*.st
    # Format for fine-tuning
    # Create instruction/response pairs
```

### 3. Test Local Fine-Tuning (Next Week)
```bash
# Try with Ollama first
ollama create mgx-assistant --file Modelfile
# Where Modelfile contains your training approach
```

## üéØ Recommendation

For your Smalltalk codebase, I recommend:

1. **Short Term**: Keep using RAG but add Smalltalk-specific parsing
2. **Medium Term**: Train a LoRA adapter on your patterns (best ROI)
3. **Long Term**: Full fine-tuning if you need production code generation

The combination of RAG + LoRA will give you:
- Immediate answers about existing code (RAG)
- Ability to generate new code in your style (LoRA)
- Understanding of your specific patterns
- Cost-effective approach
