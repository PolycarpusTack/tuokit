- Each with before/after examples

### Snippet Categories
- Collections (Creating, Iterating, Filtering, Transforming)
- Control Flow (Conditionals, Loops, Blocks, Exceptions)
- Classes (Definition, Instantiation, Inheritance, Traits)
- And 7 more categories

### Metaprogramming Tasks
- Add logging to all methods
- Create getter/setter methods
- Method aliasing
- Dynamic class creation
- And more advanced patterns

### Seaside Templates
- User Registration Form
- Data Table Component
- Blog Editor
- Product Catalog
- Admin Dashboard
- Task Manager

### Conversion Patterns
- Collections (Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries)
- Classes and Objects
- Blocks and Closures
- Control Structures
- Method Definitions

## Configuration

The toolkit provides unified configuration:

```python
SMALLTALK_CONFIG = {
    "default_model": "deepseek-r1:latest",
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "max_tokens": 4000,
    "supported_dialects": ["VisualWorks", "Pharo", "Squeak", "GemStone"],
    "enable_caching": True
}
```

## UI/UX Enhancements

1. **Unified Navigation**: Single sidebar with all tools
2. **Consistent Styling**: Dark theme optimized for code
3. **Smart Layouts**: Tool-specific layouts that adapt to content
4. **Quick Actions**: Templates and examples for rapid development
5. **Export Options**: Download generated code as .st files
6. **Recent History**: Track recently used tools and generations

## Technical Architecture

### Core Functions
- `generate_class()`: AI-powered class generation
- `explain_code()`: Multi-level code explanation
- `generate_metaprogramming()`: Dynamic code generation
- `refactor_code()`: Intelligent refactoring
- `convert_code()`: Bidirectional Ruby conversion
- `generate_snippet()`: Task-based snippet creation
- `generate_seaside_component()`: Web component generation

### Shared Utilities
- Pattern matching and parsing
- Knowledge base integration
- Model configuration
- Error handling
- File export functionality

## Usage

```bash
# Run the consolidated toolkit
streamlit run smalltalk_toolkit.py
```

The application provides seven integrated tools accessible from the sidebar:
1. üèóÔ∏è Class Generator - Create complete Smalltalk classes
2. üîç Code Explainer - Understand Smalltalk code
3. üîÆ Metaprogramming - Generate dynamic code
4. ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring - Improve code structure
5. üíé Ruby Converter - Convert between languages
6. üìö Snippet Library - Find code patterns
7. üåä Seaside Generator - Create web components

## Benefits

1. **Single Entry Point**: One file replaces seven separate tools
2. **Integrated Workflow**: Seamlessly switch between tools
3. **Shared Resources**: Common patterns and configurations
4. **Consistent Experience**: Unified UI/UX across all tools
5. **Better Performance**: Shared caching and optimizations
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: From basic classes to web frameworks

## Migration Guide

To migrate from individual tools:

1. Replace all individual tool imports with:
   ```python
   from smalltalk_toolkit import *
   ```

2. Update tool references:
   - `smalltalk_class_gen.py` ‚Üí Use Class Generator in toolkit
   - `smalltalk_explainer.py` ‚Üí Use Code Explainer in toolkit
   - etc.

3. All saved data and knowledge base entries remain compatible

The consolidated toolkit maintains backward compatibility while providing a superior development experience for Smalltalk programmers.
