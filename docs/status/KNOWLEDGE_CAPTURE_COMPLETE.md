# üß† Knowledge Capture Integration for TuoKit Agent Hub

## Overview

I've successfully integrated comprehensive knowledge capture into the TuoKit Agent Hub. Every agent operation is now automatically captured and stored in PostgreSQL for building a searchable knowledge base.

## What's Been Added

### 1. Enhanced Knowledge Capture System (`knowledge_capture_enhanced.py`)
A comprehensive system that captures:
- **Agent Operations**: Every tool execution with full context
- **Execution Plans**: Complete agent planning and orchestration
- **Analysis Results**: Data insights, patterns, and correlations
- **Learning Scenarios**: Educational content and outcomes
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution times, success rates, confidence scores

### 2. Knowledge Database Tables
Four new PostgreSQL tables:
- `agent_knowledge_entries` - Main knowledge storage
- `knowledge_relationships` - Links between related knowledge
- `knowledge_usage` - Tracks knowledge reuse
- `knowledge_search_cache` - Optimizes searches

### 3. Management Scripts

#### `manage_knowledge_db.py`
```bash
# Create knowledge tables
python manage_knowledge_db.py create

# View statistics
python manage_knowledge_db.py stats

# Search knowledge
python manage_knowledge_db.py search --query "error handling"

# Export knowledge
python manage_knowledge_db.py export --output knowledge.json

# Cleanup old entries
python manage_knowledge_db.py cleanup --days 90
```

#### `knowledge_capture_wrapper.py`
Provides decorators and auto-wrapping for existing agents without modifying original code.

### 4. Integration Points

The knowledge capture is integrated at multiple levels:

1. **Tool Execution Level**
   - Every tool execution is captured with parameters and results
   - Performance metrics tracked automatically
   - Error cases captured for learning

2. **Agent Planning Level**
   - Complete execution plans captured
   - Step-by-step progress tracked
   - Dependencies and relationships preserved

3. **Analysis Level**
   - All data insights saved
   - Patterns and correlations captured
   - Confidence scores assigned

4. **Educational Level**
   - Learning scenarios tracked
   - Outcomes measured
   - Reusable tutorials created

## How It Works

### Automatic Capture Flow

```
User Request ‚Üí Agent Selection ‚Üí Planning Phase (captured)
                                       ‚Üì
                              Tool Execution (captured)
                                       ‚Üì
                               Results Analysis (captured)
                                       ‚Üì
                              Knowledge Base (PostgreSQL)
```

### Knowledge Entry Structure

Each captured entry includes:
- **Identification**: Agent name, tool, operation type
- **Categorization**: Category/subcategory, tags
- **Content**: Input parameters, output results, full content
- **Metadata**: Execution time, success status, error messages
- **Quality Metrics**: Confidence score, reusability score
- **Relationships**: Links to related knowledge

## Usage

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Install requirements (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create knowledge tables
python manage_knowledge_db.py create
```

### 2. Using Agents (Automatic Capture)

All agent operations are automatically captured:

```python
# System Architecture Design
agent = SystemArchitectAgent()
architecture = agent.generate_architecture("E-commerce platform")
# ‚úÖ Automatically captured with quality score, risks, etc.

# Deep Research
agent = DeepResearchAgent()
report = agent.research_topic("Kubernetes autoscaling")
# ‚úÖ Automatically captured with insights and resources

# Data Analysis
agent = DataAnalysisAgentEnhanced()
results = agent.analyze_dataframe_enhanced(df, "sales_data")
# ‚úÖ Automatically captured with patterns, quality scores, insights
```

### 3. Viewing Captured Knowledge

```bash
# View statistics
python manage_knowledge_db.py stats

# Example output:
üìä Knowledge Base Statistics
============================
Total Knowledge Entries: 156
  SystemArchitect: 42 entries
  DeepResearch: 38 entries
  DataAnalysis: 76 entries

‚úÖ Success Rate: 94.2%
üéØ High Confidence Entries: 132
```

### 4. Searching Knowledge

```python
from knowledge_capture_enhanced import knowledge_capture

# Search by category
results = knowledge_capture.query_knowledge({
    "category": "architecture",
    "min_confidence": 0.8
})

# Search by agent
results = knowledge_capture.query_knowledge({
    "agent_name": "SystemArchitect",
    "tags": ["microservices", "scaling"]
})
```

### 5. Knowledge Explorer UI

The Agent Hub Enhanced now includes a Knowledge Explorer tab where you can:
- Browse captured knowledge by category
- Search with filters
- View related knowledge
- See confidence and reusability scores

## Benefits

### 1. üìö Automatic Learning
- Every agent operation contributes to the knowledge base
- Failed operations captured for learning
- Patterns emerge from repeated operations

### 2. üîç Searchable History
- Find past solutions quickly
- Learn from previous errors
- Discover patterns across projects

### 3. üìà Quality Improvement
- Track success rates over time
- Identify high-value knowledge
- Measure agent performance

### 4. ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusability
- Highly reusable knowledge marked
- Similar problems linked together
- Solutions evolve over time

### 5. üéØ Confidence Tracking
- Each entry has confidence score
- High-confidence knowledge prioritized
- Low-confidence entries reviewed

## Advanced Features

### Knowledge Relationships
Related knowledge is automatically linked:
- Similar operations
- Same error patterns
- Related architectures
- Connected insights

### Performance Metrics
Every operation tracks:
- Execution time
- Memory usage (when applicable)
- Retry counts
- Success/failure rates

### Intelligent Categorization
Knowledge automatically categorized by:
- Tool type
- Operation type
- Error patterns
- Solution patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Semantic Search**: Add vector embeddings for similarity search
2. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Visual representation of relationships
3. **Auto-suggestions**: Suggest relevant knowledge during operations
4. **Team Sharing**: Share knowledge across team members
5. **Export Templates**: Generate reusable templates from knowledge

## Summary

The knowledge capture system is now fully integrated into TuoKit's Agent Hub. Every agent operation automatically contributes to a growing, searchable knowledge base that makes the system smarter over time. The more you use TuoKit, the more valuable it becomes!

No manual capture needed - just use the agents normally and watch your knowledge base grow! üöÄ
