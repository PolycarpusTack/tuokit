## 📊 Configuration Options

All settings are configurable via `CRASH_ANALYZER_CONFIG`:

```python
CRASH_ANALYZER_CONFIG = {
    "max_file_size_mb": 5,              # Maximum file size
    "chunk_size": 8000,                 # Bytes per chunk
    "chunk_overlap": 400,               # Overlap between chunks
    "max_chunks": 700,                  # Max chunks (5MB support)
    "smart_sampling_threshold_mb": 1,   # When to suggest sampling
    "performance_warning_threshold_seconds": 30,
    "pattern_match_context_chars": 100, # Context around matches
    "enable_abort": True,               # Allow aborting
    "chunk_processing_delay": 0.1       # Delay between chunks
}
```

## 🎯 Usage Improvements

### For Small Files (<1MB):
- Automatic smart extraction
- Pattern detection runs immediately
- Fast basic analysis available

### For Medium Files (1-3MB):
- Clear warnings about processing time
- All analysis methods available
- Smart sampling recommended

### For Large Files (3-5MB):
- Time estimates shown upfront
- Checkbox confirmation required
- Abort button always visible
- Progress tracking throughout

## 🔍 Pattern Detection Enhancements

Now includes 8 patterns with full context:
1. NullPointerException (High)
2. OutOfMemoryError (Critical)
3. StackOverflow (High)
4. DatabaseTimeout (Medium)
5. FileNotFound (Low)
6. DeadlockDetected (High)
7. PermissionDenied (Medium)
8. NetworkError (Medium)

Each pattern shows:
- Severity level with color coding
- Matched text from the file
- Context around the match
- Quick fix suggestion
- Prevention strategy

## 📈 Performance Stats

New performance dashboard shows:
- Basic analysis time
- Expert analysis time
- Chunk analysis time
- Method used

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

- **Severity Colors**: 🔴 Critical, 🟠 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low
- **File Icons**: 📄 Lines, 💾 Size, 🐛 Errors, 📚 Stack Frames
- **Status Icons**: ✅ Success, ⚠️ Warning, 📊 Analysis
- **Progress**: Real-time bars with percentages

## 💡 Smart Features

1. **Automatic Method Selection**: Based on file size
2. **Pattern Pre-scanning**: Quick scan of first 10KB
3. **Time Estimation**: Accurate predictions for processing
4. **Intelligent Aggregation**: Combines results from all chunks
5. **Context Preservation**: No information lost between chunks

## 🏆 Summary

The crash analyzer now includes **ALL suggested improvements** and is ready for production use. It maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new features for handling large files, better pattern detection, and improved user experience.

The implementation follows TuoKit's philosophy:
- **Build fast**: Quick analysis options available
- **Build smart**: Intelligent extraction and sampling
- **Build exactly what's needed**: Full 5MB support as requested
