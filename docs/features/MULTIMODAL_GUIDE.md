# üñºÔ∏è MultiModal Features for Broadcast Teams

## Screenshot Debugging ‚úÖ

### What It Does
- **Extracts text** from error screenshots using OCR
- **Analyzes errors** with broadcast-specific context
- **Identifies UI issues** in WHAT'S ON interface
- **Client-aware** - knows ESPN uses RTMP, NBC uses HLS

### How to Use

```python
from toolkits.agent_hub import MultiModalAgent

# Create agent
agent = MultiModalAgent()

# Analyze screenshot
result = agent.execute_tool("analyze_screenshot", {
    'image_path': "espn_error.png",
    'client': "ESPN",
    'context': "Stream dropped during Monday Night Football"
})

# Get analysis
print(result['extracted_text'])  # OCR text
print(result['analysis'])        # AI insights
```

### Real Examples
- **ESPN scoreboard freeze** ‚Üí "Restart graphics engine"
- **NBC schedule gap** ‚Üí "Check affiliate sync" 
- **CBS signal warning** ‚Üí "Verify encoder settings"

## Document Analysis ‚úÖ

### What It Does
- **Extracts text** from PDF contracts and specs
- **Checks compliance** against FCC, GDPR, CCPA
- **Identifies risks** in legal documents
- **Finds key terms** like SLAs and penalties

### How to Use

```python
# Check compliance
result = agent.execute_tool("check_compliance", {
    'pdf_path': "NBC_Contract_2024.pdf",
    'regulations': ["FCC", "GDPR", "CCPA"]
})

# Review contract
result = agent.execute_tool("analyze_document", {
    'pdf_path': "ESPN_SLA.pdf",
    'doc_type': "contract"
})
```

### Legal Team Benefits
- **Fast compliance checks** - No manual searching
- **Risk identification** - Flags concerning clauses
- **Change tracking** - Compare contract versions
- **Audit trail** - All checks logged in memory

## Client-Specific Patterns üéØ

### Built-in Client Knowledge

```python
ESPN = {
    "protocols": ["RTMP", "HLS"],
    "common_issues": ["stream drops", "audio sync", "scoreboard overlay"],
    "ui_elements": ["live ticker", "score bug", "stats panel"]
}

NBC = {
    "protocols": ["HLS", "DASH"],  
    "common_issues": ["peacock integration", "affiliate feeds", "time zones"],
    "ui_elements": ["program guide", "local news insert", "weather"]
}
```

### Smart Analysis
When you say "ESPN", the system knows:
- Check RTMP configuration first
- Look for scoreboard-related issues
- Consider Monday Night Football timing
- Reference past ESPN-specific fixes

## Memory Integration üíæ

### Every Analysis Remembered

```python
# Screenshot analysis ‚Üí Saved
BroadcastMemoryPatterns.remember_customer_issue(
    memory, "ESPN", 
    "RTMP drops during MNF",
    "Increased buffer to 10s"
)

# Compliance check ‚Üí Saved  
BroadcastMemoryPatterns.remember_compliance_check(
    memory, "ESPN_Contract",
    "FCC", "Compliant",
    "All broadcast requirements met"
)
```

### Find Past Solutions
```python
# "Have we seen this ESPN error before?"
similar = memory.search_memories("multimodal", "ESPN RTMP")
# Returns: Previous screenshots and fixes
```

## Quick MultiModal Pipelines üîÑ

### Incident Response Pipeline
```python
pipeline = quick_pipeline([
    {"do": "analyze CBS error screenshot", "with": "analyze_screenshot"},
    {"do": "check CBS contract SLA", "with": "analyze_document"},
    {"do": "generate incident report", "with": "doc_generator"},
    {"do": "draft customer email", "with": "doc_generator"}
])
```

### Compliance Audit Pipeline
```python
pipeline = quick_pipeline([
    {"do": "analyze all Q4 contracts", "with": "analyze_document"},
    {"do": "check FCC compliance", "with": "check_compliance"},
    {"do": "generate audit report", "with": "doc_generator"}
])
```

## Setup Requirements

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install pillow        # Image processing
pip install pytesseract   # OCR engine
pip install PyPDF2        # PDF reading

# Also need Tesseract OCR installed:
# Windows: Download from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
# Mac: brew install tesseract
# Linux: apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

### Note on OCR
- Works best with clear screenshots
- Error dialogs OCR well
- Supports multiple languages
- Can handle WHAT'S ON interface layouts

## Practical Tips

### For Support Team
1. **Always include client name** - Enables smart analysis
2. **Add context** - "During prime time" helps
3. **Multiple screenshots** - Before/after comparisons
4. **Check memory first** - Maybe already solved

### For Legal Team  
1. **Batch process contracts** - Check all at once
2. **Set regulation priorities** - FCC first for broadcast
3. **Export compliance reports** - For audit trails
4. **Track changes** - Compare contract versions

### For Developers
1. **Debugging screenshots** - See exact error state
2. **Config screenshots** - Verify settings visually  
3. **Multi-client testing** - ESPN vs NBC UI differences
4. **Performance graphs** - Analyze metric screenshots

## What's Next?

With these features you can:
- **Reduce diagnosis time** from 30 min ‚Üí 5 min
- **Standardize compliance** across all contracts
- **Build client knowledge** automatically
- **Share solutions** via memory system

No complex setup. No overengineering. Just practical tools that work.
