# üéØ TuoKit Practical Features for Broadcast Teams

## What We Built (No Overengineering!)

### 1. **Agent Templates** ‚úÖ
Pre-configured workflows for your specific team needs:

#### For Developers
- **Broadcast API Debugger** - Analyzes RTMP/HLS/WebRTC issues
- **Stream Performance Analyzer** - Checks bitrate, latency, quality

#### For Support Team  
- **Ticket Resolver** - Searches past issues, suggests solutions
- **Customer Response Generator** - Professional, technical responses

#### For Legal Team
- **Compliance Checker** - FCC/GDPR/CCPA scanning
- **License Analyzer** - Dependency license compatibility

#### For Sales Team
- **Demo Builder** - Quick code snippets and talking points
- **Technical FAQ Generator** - Answer common buyer questions

#### For Analysts
- **Broadcast Analytics Pipeline** - Viewer metrics, quality analysis
- **Performance Reports** - Executive summaries with data

### 2. **Quick Agent Builder** ‚úÖ
Create agents in seconds:
```python
# Example: Monitor for specific broadcaster
monitor = quick_agent(
    name="ESPN Monitor",
    tools=["check_stream", "alert_issues"],
    prompts={
        "check_stream": "Monitor ESPN feed at {url} for quality",
        "alert_issues": "Alert if issues found: {problems}"
    }
)
```

### 3. **Persistent Memory** ‚úÖ
Practical memory that actually helps:

#### What It Remembers
- **Support**: Customer issues and resolutions
- **Dev**: API errors and fixes
- **Legal**: Compliance check history
- **Sales**: Successful demo patterns

#### How It Helps
```python
# Support rep checks: "Have we seen RTMP drops before?"
similar_issues = memory.search_memories("support_agent", "RTMP drop")
# Returns: Previous fixes that worked
```

### 4. **Simple Pipelines** ‚úÖ
Chain tasks without complexity:
```python
# One-liner pipeline
pipeline = quick_pipeline([
    {"do": "analyze error log", "with": "error_decoder"},
    {"do": "suggest fix", "with": "code_generator"},
    {"do": "update docs", "with": "doc_generator"}
])
```

## What Makes Sense for Broadcast Software

### Memory Patterns That Matter
1. **Streaming Issues** - Remember what fixed ESPN's RTMP drops
2. **API Patterns** - That WebRTC negotiation bug from last month
3. **Customer Preferences** - NBC prefers HLS, CBS uses DASH
4. **Compliance History** - When we last checked GDPR compliance

### Practical Use Cases

#### Morning Support Check
```python
# Support lead runs this each morning
memory.get_context("support_agent", days_back=7)
# Shows: Frequent issues this week, recent resolutions
```

#### Pre-Demo Prep  
```python
# Sales rep preparing for demo
template = AgentTemplates.get_template("sales_demo_builder")
# Generates: Code examples, ROI talking points, Q&A prep
```

#### Compliance Audit
```python
# Legal quarterly check
results = memory.search_memories("compliance_agent", "Q4 2024")
# Shows: All components checked, any issues found
```

## What We DON'T Need

‚ùå **Visual Pipeline Builder** - Your devs prefer code  
‚ùå **Agent Marketplace** - You're not selling agents internally  
‚ùå **Complex Analytics** - Simple memory search is enough  
‚ùå **AI Memory Systems** - SQLite with smart queries works fine  

## Multi-Modal: When It Makes Sense

For broadcast software, multi-modal could be valuable for:
- **Video Quality Analysis** - AI reviewing actual stream output
- **Audio Issue Detection** - Analyzing audio drops/sync issues  
- **Screenshot Debugging** - Support analyzing user screenshots

But start with text-based analysis first. Add multi-modal when you hit real limitations.

## Next Practical Steps

1. **Set Up Team Templates** - Customize the templates for your exact workflows
2. **Train Memory** - Start capturing real issues and resolutions
3. **Quick Agents** - Create monitors for your top 10 customers
4. **Export/Import** - Simple JSON files for sharing workflows

## Real Example: ESPN Stream Issue

```python
# Support gets ticket: "ESPN stream dropping"

# 1. Check memory for similar issues
similar = BroadcastMemoryPatterns.search_similar_issues(memory, "stream dropping")
# Finds: "RTMP timeout - fixed by increasing buffer"

# 2. Run quick analysis
result = orchestrator.orchestrate("Debug ESPN RTMP stream drops")
# Discovers: Firewall closing idle connections

# 3. Remember the solution
BroadcastMemoryPatterns.remember_customer_issue(
    memory, 
    "ESPN",
    "RTMP drops every 10min", 
    "Increase keepalive to 30s"
)

# 4. Next time: Instant answer from memory!
```

## The Bottom Line

This isn't about fancy AI - it's about:
- **Remembering what worked** (persistent memory)
- **Not repeating investigations** (smart search)
- **Quick tools for repetitive tasks** (templates)
- **Sharing knowledge across teams** (unified memory)

Simple. Practical. Useful. No overengineering.
