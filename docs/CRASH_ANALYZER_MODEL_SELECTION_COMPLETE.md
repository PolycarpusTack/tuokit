# Crash Analyzer Model Selection - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented dynamic model selection for the Crash Analyzer, allowing users to choose which Ollama model to use for analysis and tracking which model was used for each crash analysis.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Model Selection Widget** âœ…
- **Location**: `/pages/crash_analyzer.py` - `show_model_selection()` function
- **Features**:
  - Dropdown with all available Ollama models
  - Real-time model status checking (Ready/Needs Pull/Pull Failed)
  - Model refresh button to reload available models
  - Smart defaults (prefers deepseek-r1:latest, then 1.5b, llama2, mistral)
  - Model information expandable section

### 2. **Model Status Indicators** âœ…
- **Green (ðŸŸ¢)**: Model is ready for use
- **Yellow (ðŸŸ¡)**: Model needs to be pulled (will download automatically)
- **Red (ðŸ”´)**: Model pull previously failed (won't retry to avoid loops)

### 3. **Database Schema Updates** âœ…
- **Migration Script**: `/scripts/migration/add_model_column_to_crash_instances.py`
- **New Column**: `model_used VARCHAR(100)` in `crash_instances` table
- **Index**: Created for performance on model filtering
- **Analytics**: Updated views to include model information

### 4. **Integration with Analysis Functions** âœ…
- **Basic Analysis**: Uses selected model from session state
- **Expert Diagnostics**: Uses selected model from session state
- **Smart Sampling**: Uses selected model from session state
- **Full File Analysis**: Uses selected model from session state (chunked processing)

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling** âœ…
- **Infinite Retry Prevention**: Fixed the repeated model pulling issue
- **Failed Model Caching**: Tracks models that failed to pull
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Continues with default model if selection fails

## Code Changes

### UI Components
```python
def show_model_selection():
    """Display model selection widget and return selected model"""
    # Gets available models from Ollama
    # Shows model status and health
    # Provides refresh capability
    # Stores selection in session state
```

### Database Integration
```sql
-- New column added to crash_instances
ALTER TABLE crash_instances 
ADD COLUMN model_used VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'deepseek-r1:latest';

-- New index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_crash_instances_model ON crash_instances(model_used);
```

### Analysis Functions
```python
# All analysis functions now use:
model = st.session_state.get("selected_model", "deepseek-r1:latest")

# And save the model used:
model_used=selected_model
```

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Upload Crash File**: Choose your crash dump file
2. **Select Model**: Pick from available Ollama models in the dropdown
3. **Analyze**: Run any analysis method (Basic, Expert, Smart Sampling, Full File)
4. **Save Results**: The model used will be automatically recorded

### For Administrators
1. **View Model Usage**: Query `crash_instances` table to see which models are being used
2. **Performance Analysis**: Compare analysis quality across different models
3. **Resource Planning**: Track which models are most popular

## Analytics Enhancements

### Updated Views
- `crash_pattern_summary`: Now includes `models_used` count and `model_list` array
- `recent_crashes`: Includes model information for recent analyses

### New Metrics Available
- **Model Distribution**: Which models are used most frequently
- **Quality by Model**: Compare analysis quality across models
- **Performance by Model**: Track analysis speed by model type

## Security & Performance

### Fixed Issues
- **Infinite Model Pulling**: Prevents repeated download attempts for failed models
- **Resource Leaks**: Better cleanup of failed model operations
- **Session State**: Proper model selection persistence

### Performance Improvements
- **Model Caching**: Failed model attempts are cached to avoid retries
- **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent model selection based on availability
- **Async Model Checks**: Non-blocking model status verification

## Database Migration

To enable the new functionality:

```bash
# Run the migration (when database is available)
python3 scripts/migration/add_model_column_to_crash_instances.py

# Or rollback if needed
python3 scripts/migration/add_model_column_to_crash_instances.py --rollback
```

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Model Comparison
1. Upload same crash file
2. Analyze with different models (deepseek-r1:latest vs llama2)
3. Compare analysis quality and insights
4. Save both results with model tracking

### Scenario 2: Model Performance Testing
1. Set up multiple models in Ollama
2. Use Crash Analyzer to test each model's capabilities
3. Review database analytics to see which models perform best
4. Make informed decisions about default model selection

### Scenario 3: Specialized Model Usage
1. Use lighter models (1.5b) for quick analysis
2. Use larger models for complex crashes requiring deep analysis
3. Track resource usage and analysis quality by model type

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Track analysis time by model
- **Auto Model Selection**: Choose best model based on crash type
- **Model Recommendations**: Suggest optimal model for specific crash patterns
- **Batch Model Testing**: Run same crash through multiple models automatically

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `/pages/crash_analyzer.py` - Main model selection UI and integration
- `/utils/ollama.py` - Enhanced model management and error handling
- `/utils/json_helper.py` - Dynamic model selection in analysis functions

### Database
- `/scripts/migration/add_model_column_to_crash_instances.py` - Database schema update

### Testing
- `/tests/test_crash_analyzer_model_selection.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Verification

The implementation provides:
âœ… **Model Selection UI** - Dropdown with available models  
âœ… **Status Indicators** - Visual model health status  
âœ… **Database Tracking** - Records which model was used  
âœ… **Error Prevention** - Stops infinite model pulling loops  
âœ… **Session Persistence** - Remembers selected model  
âœ… **Analytics Integration** - Model data in crash pattern analysis  
âœ… **Performance Monitoring** - Track model usage patterns  

## Summary

The Crash Analyzer now provides complete model selection functionality, allowing users to:
- Choose their preferred analysis model from available Ollama models
- See real-time model status and health
- Track which models provide the best analysis results
- Prevent resource waste from failed model downloads
- Make informed decisions about model usage based on analytics

This enhancement significantly improves the flexibility and analytical capabilities of the Crash Analyzer while maintaining ease of use and system stability.
