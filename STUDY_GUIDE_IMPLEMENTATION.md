# Study Guide Generator Implementation Summary

## What Was Added to TuoKit

### 1. File Handler Utility (`utils/file_handler.py`)
A new utility module following TuoKit Architect principles:
- **extract_text()**: Handles PDF, TXT, and DOCX files with robust error handling
- **extract_pdf()**: Uses PyMuPDF with PyPDF2 fallback
- **extract_docx()**: Basic DOCX support via XML parsing
- **extract_text_from_url()**: Simple web scraping without heavy dependencies
- **validate_file_size()**: Prevents processing of oversized files

### 2. Study Guide Generator Page (`pages/study_guide_generator.py`)
Main educational tool implementation:
- Multiple input methods (Text, File Upload, URL)
- Configurable difficulty levels and learning objectives
- Generates four types of study materials:
  - Summaries (bullet points)
  - Flashcards (Q&A pairs)
  - Quizzes (multiple choice)
  - Key Terms (vocabulary with definitions)
- Export functionality (text format)
- Knowledge Library integration with metadata

### 3. Navigation Updates
- Added to sidebar navigation in `app.py`
- Added quick start button on dashboard
- Integrated with existing TuoKit navigation flow

### 4. Testing & Documentation
- Created `tests/test_study_guide.py` for unit testing
- Created `docs/study_guide_generator.md` with comprehensive usage guide
- Added inline documentation and TODOs for future enhancements

### 5. Dependencies
- Added `requests==2.31.0` to requirements.txt
- Listed optional dependencies for future features (NLTK, BeautifulSoup4, python-docx)

## Key Design Decisions (Following TuoKit Architect Principles)

### 1. Minimalist Implementation
- No NLTK dependency initially - simple text processing first
- Used existing Ollama integration instead of custom API
- Leveraged existing database structure (metadata support already present)
- Simple HTML parsing instead of BeautifulSoup dependency

### 2. Error Prevention
- Comprehensive try-except blocks in all extraction functions
- File size validation before processing
- Graceful fallbacks for parsing failures
- Clear error messages for users

### 3. Practical Optimization
- Content truncation to avoid token limits (2000 chars)
- Smaller model (1.5b) as default for speed
- Chunked file reading for large documents
- Simple text export format (no complex PDF generation)

### 4. Extensibility
- Modular parsing functions for easy enhancement
- TODO comments for planned features
- Clean separation of concerns (extraction, generation, display)
- Metadata storage for future analytics

## Testing the Implementation

To test the Study Guide Generator:

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   cd C:/Projects/Tuokit
   python tests/test_study_guide.py
   ```

2. **Start TuoKit and navigate to Study Guide**:
   - Click "ðŸ“š Study Guide" in sidebar or quick start
   - Try different input methods
   - Generate materials with various settings

3. **Verify integration**:
   - Check Knowledge Library for saved materials
   - Test export functionality
   - Confirm error handling with invalid inputs

## Future Enhancements (Already Planned)

1. **Advanced NLP**: Add NLTK for concept extraction
2. **Export Formats**: Anki decks, formatted PDFs
3. **Learning Features**: Spaced repetition scheduling
4. **Content Enhancement**: Image extraction, multi-language support
5. **Performance**: Implement content caching

## Potential Improvements & Cleanup Recommendations

### 1. Code Organization
- Consider creating a dedicated `educational` module for all learning tools
- The file handler could be expanded to a general document processing utility

### 2. Model Configuration
- Study Guide Generator uses hardcoded models - could use the global selected_model
- Consider adding model-specific prompt templates

### 3. Database Schema
- While metadata support exists, consider a dedicated table for educational content
- Add indexes for content_hash to speed up deduplication

### 4. UI Consistency
- Study Guide uses different UI patterns than other tools
- Consider standardizing the tab layout across all tools

### 5. Testing Coverage
- Add integration tests with actual Ollama calls
- Test edge cases (empty content, huge files, malformed URLs)

## Summary

The Study Guide Generator has been successfully integrated into TuoKit following the established patterns and principles. It provides immediate value while maintaining the project's focus on practical, minimalist implementation. The tool is ready for use and positioned for future enhancements based on user feedback.
